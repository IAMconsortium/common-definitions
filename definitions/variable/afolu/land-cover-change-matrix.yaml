# Level-0 Land Cover Change Matrix
- Land Cover Change Matrix|from {Level-0a Land Cover} to {Level-0b Land Cover}:
    description: Annual gross area transition from {Level-0a Land Cover} to {Level-0b Land Cover}
    notes: This variable should be computed as yearly average change between the previous and the current reported time step. It should be computed at the finest spatial resolution possible (e.g. grid level).
    unit: million ha/yr
