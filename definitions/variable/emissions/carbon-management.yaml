# Carbon Capture is grouped into two levels of aggregation based on the fate of the captured CO2.

- Carbon Capture:
    description: Total amount of captured carbon dioxide (CO2) from energy use in supply and demand sectors (IPCC category 1A, 1B) and from industrial processes 
        (IPCC categories 2A, B, C, E), including emissions from international bunkers, net of negative emissions from bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), 
        direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and other CO2 removal (exclusive of land-use change) in these sectors
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

- Carbon Capture|Geological Storage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is injected into subsurface geologic storage reservoirs (e.g., in situ mineralization).
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
    note: Captured CO2 that is reacted at the earth's surface (e.g., ex situ mineralization) should be reported under Carbon Capture|Other Storage

- Carbon Capture|Leakage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is subsequently vented, leaked, or reemitted during or after transmission to storage repositories
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
    note: Leakage of CO2 stored in previous years should be reported here
    
- Carbon Capture|Other Storage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is stored in reservoirs not elsewhere specified
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

- Carbon Capture|Utilization:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is used in the manufacture of fuels, materials, or to enhance the productivity of oil and/or natural gas reservoirs.
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

- Carbon Capture|Utilization|Durable Storage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is used in the manufacture durable materials (e.g., cement), 
        or to enhance the productivity of oil and/or natural gas reservoirs wherein the captured carbon is stored on centenial or longer timescales. 
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
    
- Carbon Capture|Utilization|Short-lived Storage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is used in the manufacture of fuels or short-lived materials 
        wherin the captured carbon is reemitted to the atmosphere upon consumption of these products or within annual to decadal timescales. 
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
