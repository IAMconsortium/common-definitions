- Carbon Capture:
    description: Total amount of captured carbon dioxide (CO2) from energy use in supply
      and demand sectors (IPCC category 1A, 1B) and from industrial processes
      (IPCC categories 2A, B, C, E), including emissions from international bunkers,
      net of negative emissions from bioenergy with CCS (BECCS),
      direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and other CO2 removal exclusive of
      land-use change in these sectors

- Carbon Capture|Geological Storage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is injected into subsurface geologic
      storage reservoirs (e.g., in situ mineralization).
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
    tier: 1
    lower_bound: 0
    notes: Captured CO2 that is reacted at the earth's surface (e.g., ex situ mineralization)

    notes: Leakage should be reported as positive values. Leakage of CO2 stored in
      previous years should be reported here.
