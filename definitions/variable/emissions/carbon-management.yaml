# Carbon Capture is grouped into two levels of aggregation based on the fate of the captured CO2.
# Level-1 reports whether captured CO2 is stored, utilized, or leaked
# Level-2 reports additional disaggregation for long-lived vs. short-lived utilization.

- Carbon Capture:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) from energy use in supply and demand sectors (IPCC category 1A, 1B) and from industrial processes 
        (IPCC categories 2A, B, C, E), including emissions from international bunkers, net of negative emissions from bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), 
        direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and other CO2 removal (exclusive of land-use change) in these sectors
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

- Carbon Capture|Geologic Storage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is injected into subsurface geologic storage reservoirs (e.g., in situ mineralization).
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
    note: Captured CO2 that is reacted at the earth's surface (e.g., ex situ mineralization) should be reported under Carbon Capture|Other Storage

- Carbon Capture|Leakage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is subsequently vented, leaked, or reemitted during or after transmission to storage repositories
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
    note: Leakage of CO2 stored in previous years should be reported here
    
- Carbon Capture|Other Storage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is stored in reservoirs not elsewhere specified
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

-Carbon Capture|Utilization:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is used in the manufacture of fuels, materials, or to enhance the productivity of oil and/or natural gas reservoirs.
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

-Carbon Capture|Utilization|Durable Storage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is used in the manufacture durable materials (e.g., cement), 
        or to enhance the productivity of oil and/or natural gas reservoirs wherein the captured carbon is stored on centenial or longer timescales. 
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
    
-Carbon Capture|Utilization|Short-lived Storage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is used in the manufacture of fuels or short-lived materials 
        wherin the captured carbon is reemitted to the atmosphere upon consumption of these products or within annual to decadal timescales. 
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

# Carbon Removal reports the method of CDR in level-1, with additional disaggration as to the fate of removed carbon for materials in Level-2

- Carbon Removal:
    description: Gross removals of CO2 from the atmosphere through deliberate human activities
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

- Carbon Removal|Biochar:
    description: production of biochar using pyrolysis
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

- Carbon Removal|Direct Air Capture:
    description: CO2 captured directly from the atmosphere in solvent, sorbent, or other chemical processes, excluding any fossil process heat.
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

- Carbon Removal|Direct Ocean Capture:
    description: dissolved inorganic carbon that is electrochemically separated from seawater and stored in geologic reservoirs or other long-term storage
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

- Carbon Removal|Terrestrial Enhanced Weathering:
    description: Carbon dioxide (CO2) removed from the atmosphere by spreading ground silicate bearing rock 
        over croplands or terrestrial ecosystems, thereby converting aqueous CO2 into solid carbonate minerals or ocean alkalinity
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

- Carbon Removal|Ocean:
    description: Carbon dioxide (CO2) removed from the atmopshere and stored in the ocean as alkalinity, biomass sinking, or other long-term storage
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

- Carbon Removal|Ocean|Alkalinization:
    description: Carbon dioxide (CO2) removed from the atmopshere and stored in the ocean as alkalinity
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

- Carbon Removal|Materials:
    description: Carbon dioxide (CO2) of atmospheric or biomass origin that is stored in long-lived materials with centenial to millenial residence times for the carbon. 
    unit: Mt CO2/yr

- Carbon Removal|Materials|Cement:
    description: Carbon dioxide (CO2) of atmospheric or biomass origin that is stored in cement
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
    note: CO2 uptake from cement carbonation, if reported, should be included under this category

- Carbon Removal|Materials|Plastics: 
    description: Carbon dioxide (CO2) of atmospheric or biomass origin that is stored in plastics which are subsequently landfilled or otherwise prevented from reoxidizing for centenial or greater timescales.  
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
    note: Incineration or other leakage should be excluded or deducted from removal total
    
- Carbon Removal|Materials|Timber:
    description: Carbon dioxide (CO2) that is embodied in timber used for building construction or buried in durable repositories  
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
