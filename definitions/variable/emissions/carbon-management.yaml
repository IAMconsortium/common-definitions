# Carbon Capture is grouped into two levels of aggregation based on the fate of the captured CO2
# storage versus utilization
- Carbon Capture:
    description: Total amount of captured carbon dioxide (CO2) from energy use in supply
      and demand sectors (IPCC category 1A, 1B) and from industrial processes
      (IPCC categories 2A, B, C, E), including emissions from international bunkers,
      net of negative emissions from bioenergy with CCS (BECCS),
      direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), and other CO2 removal exclusive of
      land-use change in these sectors
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
- Carbon Capture|Geological Storage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is injected into subsurface geologic
      storage reservoirs (e.g., in situ mineralization).
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
    notes: Captured CO2 that is reacted at the earth's surface (e.g., ex situ mineralization)
      should be reported under Carbon Capture|Other Storage
- Carbon Capture|Other Storage:
    description: Other types of storage for captured carbon dioxide (CO2)
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
- Carbon Capture|Leakage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is vented, leaked, or re-emitted
      during transport or after injection into storage
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
    notes: Leakage should be reported as positive values. Leakage of CO2 stored in
      previous years should be reported here.
- Carbon Capture|Utilization:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is used in the manufacture of fuels
      or materials, or to enhance the productivity of oil and/or natural gas reservoirs
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
- Carbon Capture|Utilization|Durable Storage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is used in the manufacture durable
      materials (e.g., cement) or to enhance the productivity of oil and/or natural gas
      reservoirs where the captured carbon is stored on centennial or longer timescales
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
- Carbon Capture|Utilization|Short-Lived Storage:
    description: Captured carbon dioxide (CO2) that is used in the manufacture of fuels
      or short-lived materials where the captured carbon is re-emitted to the atmosphere
      upon consumption of these products or within annual to decadal timescales
    unit: Mt CO2/yr
