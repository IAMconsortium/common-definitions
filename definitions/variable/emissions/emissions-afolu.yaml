# Emissions species are grouped into three levels of detail for the reporting.
# Level-1 reports aggregate emissions, Level-3 has the most detailed disaggregation.
# Gross emissions are only defined for CO2.
# Emissions reporting guidance follows IPCC guidance, referring to

- Emissions|{Level-2 Species}|AFOLU:
    description: Emissions of {Level-2 Species} from agriculture, forestry
      and other land use (IPCC 1996 category 4, 5 - IPCC 2006 category 3),
      including agricultural emissions from livestock, rice cultivation and soil management
      as well as emissions from land use and land-use change such as deforestation,
      conversion of non-forest natural land, and drained peatlands
    unit: "{Level-2 Species}"
    tier: 1
    notes: This variable reports the sum of sources and sinks including land-use methods
      such as soil carbon sequestration, biochar, forestry, and re/afforestation and
      agroforestry. It uses the model/scientific definition of AFOLU, and does not align
      with the reporting of national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGI).
      For NGHGI-aligned reporting, see 'Emissions|*|AFOLU [NGHGI]'. Emissions reported
      in this category represent fluxes to/from the atmosphere from/to the land pool.
      For a breakdown of carbon removals, see the 'Carbon Removal|*' variables.
