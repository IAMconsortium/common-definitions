# Emissions species are grouped into three levels of detail for the reporting.
# Level-1 reports aggregate emissions, Level-3 has the most detailed disaggregation.
# Gross emissions are only defined for CO2.

      contributions. For positive contributions only, see 
      "Gross Emissions|*").

      In particular, this includes agricultural emissions (mostly non-CO2) 
      from livestock, rice cultivation and soil management as well as 
      emissions from land use and land-use change (mostly CO2) such as deforestation, 
      conversion of non-forest natural land, and drained peatlands. 
      This is reporting the sum of sources and sinks including land-use methods that do not 
      use CCS such as soil carbon sequestration, biochar, forestry, and re/afforestation and 
      agroforestry.
