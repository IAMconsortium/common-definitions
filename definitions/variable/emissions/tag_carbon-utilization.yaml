- Carbon Utilization Type:
    - Materials:
        description: long- and short-lived materials
    - Materials|Long-Lived:
        description: long-lived materials where the carbon is stored on centennial or
          longer timescales (e.g., carbon fibers)
    - Materials|Short-Lived:
        description: short-lived materials where the captured carbon is re-emitted to
          the atmosphere upon consumption of these products or within annual to decadal
          timescales (e.g., plastics)
