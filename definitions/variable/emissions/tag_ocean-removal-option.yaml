- Ocean Removal Option:
    - Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement:
        description: increasing ocean uptake of carbon through anthropogenic alkalinity
          addition
    - Direct Ocean Capture:
        description: direct removal of CO2 from the ocean through electrodialysis or
          other methods
    - Fertilization:
        description: stimulation of the primary production of phytoplankton and other
          organisms which contribute to ocean uptake of CO2 through direct nutrient
          addition or artificially upwelling deep nutrient-rich water
    - Other:
