- Terrestrial Biodiversity|Mean Species Abundance:
    description: Terrestrial biodiversity measured in Mean Species Abundance (MSA)
    unit: '%'
    range: [ 0,100 ]
    sdg: 15
    weight: Land Cover
    tier: 3
    notes: An indicator of naturalness or biodiversity intactness. It is defined as the mean abundance 
      of original species relative to their abundance in undisturbed ecosystems. An MSA 
      (Mean Species Abundance) of 0 % means a completely destructed ecosystem, with no original species remaining.
      An MSA of 100 % indicates an undisturbed ecosystem, in which species abundance is comparable to the natural state.

- Terrestrial Biodiversity|Biodiversity Intactness Index:

      (BII)
    unit: '%'
    range: [ 0,100 ]

    navigate: Terrestrial Biodiversity|BII
    tier: 2
    notes: The Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) summarises the change in ecological communities in response 
      to human pressures. The BII is an estimated percentage of the original number of species that remain and 
      their abundance in any given area, despite human impacts. The main difference between MSA and BII is that 
      every unit of land is given equal weight in MSA, whereas BII gives more weight to species-rich areas.

      and abundance

    tier: 3
    notes: The Shannon index is a an index of crop diversity. Both the number of species and their distribution are 
      included in the calculation. Higher values indicate higher crop diversity. Typical values generally range between 1.5 and 3.5.
