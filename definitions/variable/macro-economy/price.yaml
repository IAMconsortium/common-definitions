    notes: Regional CO2 emissions can turn negative at different points in time, which
       can result in counter-intuitive aggregation results when used as weights for
       the region-aggregation. Also the [weighted by Final Energy] methods is
       complementary and overcomes other aggregation issues - regions with high carbon
       prices can be associated with low emission levels, meaning its contribution
       to the emission-weighted average of carbon prices will be low, regardless
       of the share of the global energy system the carbon price is applied to.
